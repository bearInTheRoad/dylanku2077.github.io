# Reconnaissance
No doubt we always start with Reconnaissance. Let'start with
Port Scanning and see what's the open port on this target host.

Nmaps gives the following results with a quick scan.
```shell
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-19 15:04 CST
Nmap scan report for 10.201.13.4
Host is up (0.29s latency).
Not shown: 992 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT      STATE SERVICE
22/tcp    open  ssh
25/tcp    open  smtp
110/tcp   open  pop3
143/tcp   open  imap
993/tcp   open  imaps
995/tcp   open  pop3s
4000/tcp  open  remoteanything
50000/tcp open  ibm-db2

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.87 seconds
```

Things worth noting
1. They have Port 22 open, this may be a chance for brute force
on weak passwords.
2. They have the whole smtp, pop3, imap service. That means the
website supports mail service.
3. Remonteanything is a service for remote desktop. There are
some interesting CVEs about it.
4. ibm-db2 is a database service from IBM. Why is there a database
service directly open to port scanning? It may be supporting some
web service.


Next thing, let's send a simple get request to all this ports and
see if anyone of them providing a website UI.
You will soon find that Port 4000 and Port 50000, each of them has
a website UI. But I didn't go thru all of them at first. After I found
out Port 4000 has a frontend interface, I jumped right into that
rabbithole and completely forgot Port 50000.



Next step we go to do a little subdomain exploratory. I used
a very long subdomain list ![here]() along with a self write single
thread script. The enumerating didn't finish before the machine auto 
shut down after 2 hours. I should have used a shorter payload list with
more frequently used subdomain as first recon tool. Also, I could have
used some existing tools with multi-thread - or develolp my own multi-thread
script.

The subdomain enumeratation with about 1/3 of the whole list gave me the
following avaialbe subdomains.
```shell
/images               (Status: 301) [Size: 179] [--> /images/]
/signup               (Status: 500) [Size: 1246]
/fonts                (Status: 301) [Size: 177] [--> /fonts/]
/signin               (Status: 200) [Size: 1295]
/index                (Status: 302) [Size: 29] [--> /signin]
```

Seems like nothing out of ordinary, hence I just started looking at the
actual web pages and their source codes.
